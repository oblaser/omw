# Build Scripts

The scripts must have this directory as working directory.

`dep_*` files are dependencies of the scripts and should not be called directly.



## `*.sh` Scripts

They return __0__ on success and __1__ on error.
Eexcept the `pack_*` and `build_and_test.sh`, the latter is only used during development.
